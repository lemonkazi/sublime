class ViewWatcherMediator():

    """
    Mediates between views and CoverageWatchers.

    The "callbacks" parameter is a dictionary mapping CoverageWatcher
    events to a callback which should be run when that event occurs to
    the coverage file for a view which has been added. The callback
    will be passed the view whose coverage data file has experienced
    the event, as well as a CoverageData object representing the new
    content of the file.

    When calling add(view), a CoverageWatcher will be set up to watch
    the file containing that view's coverage data. When the watcher
    detects an event, this mediator will pass the relevant view to the
    callback so that it can be informed about changes to its code
    coverage data.

    This class re-uses CoverageWatchers, so if there's multiple views
    that need to be notified about the same coverage file, there will
    be only one CoverageWatcher created.

    Calling remove(view) will de-register any watchers that were set
    up for a view by add(view). If this results in a CoverageWatchers
    having no more registered callbacks, that CoverageWatchers will be
    stopped. A new CoverageWatchers will be created and started next
    time a view is added using add(view).
