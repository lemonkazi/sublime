1.9.0:
======
   A N N O U N C E M E N T

   This release introduces git blame annotations so quickly see who changed
   a line. If you don't like it at all, you can disable line annotations
   in GitGutter.sublime-settings:

       "show_line_annotation": false

   or in Preferences.sublime-settings:

       "git_gutter_show_line_annotation": false

   The line annotation is displayed if word wrap is disabled by default due to some
   rendering issues caused by the underlying phantom text.

   The blame message is also displayed in the status bar by default.

   Both the status bar text and the line annotations can be customized via jinja2
   templates. GitGutter therefore provides a couple more variables.

   For a more detailed description of the settings, please refer to the documentation.
