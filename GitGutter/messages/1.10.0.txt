   A N N O U N C E M E N T

  This release introduces some changes to ensure GitGutter to coexist well
  with the new Incremental Diff feature of Sublime Text 3200.

  If `"mini_diff"` is set to `"auto"` or `True` in Preferences.sublime-settings
  GitGutter will no longer add icons to the normal gutter.

  Please note:

  1. GitGutter themes don't have any effect anymore if ST's mini_diff is enabled.
  2. The results of ST's mini_diff and GitGutter's diff popup or the markers
     in the minimap may differ a little bit.

  The status bar text template was tweaked to no longer show the branch name
  if Sublime Text 3189+ is detected.

  All other features keep untouched so far in order to not break any existing
  feature.

  As most of the main features of this plugin have been moved to ST's core,
  this plugin seems to become deprecated / obsolete for ST3200+ in its current
  form.
