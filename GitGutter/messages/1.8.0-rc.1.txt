1.8.0-rc.1:
===========

   A N N O U N C E M E N T

   This pre-release adds enables usage of Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

   To enable WSL just setup a unix-like path in the "git_binary" setting.

       "git_binary": "/usr/bin/git"

   Known Issues:
    1. Git via WSL runs 2 to 3 times slower than Git for Windows, which may
       cause some reasonable delayes here and there.
    2. The WSL seems to have some issues with passing long texts through the
       stdio interface. The content is simply truncated sometimes. This issue
       is worked around by reading the commited file content directly into the
       cache file, but the result of a `git diff` may still be truncated on
       large files. So GitGutter may not see some of the changes in a file.

       This WSL issue which can't be fixed by GitGutter at the moment.
