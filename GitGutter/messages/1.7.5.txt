  In manner of consistency all functions are now available via

   * command pallet
   * main menu
   * key bindings

  The command pallet is probably the best and most quickly available cheat
  sheet for key bindings which is the reason to add all commands there.

  The following main menu entries are available:

     Edit
      +- Revert Change to Commit             (ctrl+shift+alt+z)
      +- Copy Content from Commit            (ctrl+shift+c)

     View
      +- GitGutter
         +- Enable
         +- Show Diff Popup                  (ctrl+shift+alt+c, ctrl+d)
         +- ...

     Goto
      +- Goto Previous Git Difference        (ctrl+shift+alt+k)
      +- Goto Next Git Difference            (ctrl+shift+alt+j)

     Preferences
      +- Package Settings
         +- GitGutter
            +- ...

   N O T E

  The command "GitGutter: Enable/Disable" was added to provide the opportunity
  to disable GitGutter for single views.

  As this command uses ST's "toggle_setting" the setting "enable"
  in GitGutter.sublime-settings moved to Preferences.sublime-settings.

  If you need to disable GitGutter globally, you'll need to do that by adding

     "git_gutter_enable": false

  to the Preferences.sublime-settings. 

  This setting works in Project settings as well.
